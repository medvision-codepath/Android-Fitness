## 2.2 Evaluating Ideas

#### Online Group Chatting
- Mobile
    - Quick and easy communication
    - Video Call communication, Voice Call, Real-time Messaging
- Story
    - Very clear for communication with others
    - Will be helpful for group communication as well
- Market
    - The Potential user base would be anyone with a phone looking to find a way to communicate with others
    - This would be a free app so anyone is able to download and access the app
- Habit
    - Users would use this app daily to access DMs from others
    - They are able to both create group chats and new messages with other users
- Scope
    - This would be a good challenged to complete the app
    - We need to be able to create logins for each user and store that into a database to saver their info and messages


### Gym Routine Tracking App
- Mobile
    - Convenient for Progress tracking over a notebook
    - Can keep large volumes of data points spanning multiple time points with high fidelity
- Story
    - Good for fitness tracking and progress over time
    - helpful for integration into a a larger medical platform for holistic data analytics
- Market
    - Gym goers and anyone interested in tracking their health over time
    - $2 for anyone to download and utilize for robust fitness tracking
- Habit
    - Users would use this app daily for progress tracking
- Scope
    - The app makes use of all the concepts that we have learned int eh android class thus far
    - the app would mainly be intaking user data and keeping it persistent on device.


### Trolley Location App
- Mobile: The app interfaces with a ESP32 chip that supports LoRa and is also connected to a GPS and shows the location of each ESP32 node. Each of these nodes would be inside a trolley, which will send their respective information via wifi to a station Node. In this case, the app simply maps out the locations and shows it in a Google Maps.
- Story: Help users know the location of their local trolley and the approximate time these trolleys will arrive to their respetive stations without the need of a complex or costly infrastructure using IoT technology
- Market: In Puerto Rico there is an ever-growing situation in public transportation. Although essential, faces reliability challenges that generate frustration and abandonment by users due to delays and unforeseen events.To mitigate this situation, we can use IoT technology paired with our phones where users can know when and where the trolley is and plan out their traveling better.
- Habit: Occationally, only when communing public transportation
- Scope: Will allow users to access the IoT devices' location and see the trolley's route in real-time
